ARTEMIS Contributors
--------------------

The ARTEMIS software project has been mainly developed by the
[INSPIRE group](https://www.inspire.edu.gr/) at the Institute of Computer Science (ICS)
of the [Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH)](https://www.ics.forth.gr/) at Heraklion, Crete.
It is currently maintained by Vasileios Kotronis and Dimitrios Mavrommatis.

Some of the concepts involved in the project as a whole are the results of the collaboration between the INSPIRE group and
the [Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA)](https://www.caida.org) at UC
San Diego.

* Dimitrios Mavrommatis
