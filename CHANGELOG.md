- :rotating_light: Changed frontend logger from webapp_logger to artemis_logger in logging.yaml and config.py under frontend/webapp/configs.
For old versions you need to replace the name from webapp_logger to artemis_logger in these two files under your local_configs/frontend folder.
- :rotating_light: Changed helm chart labels to support multiple releases per namespace and this breaks helm upgrades.
To migrate to the new version you need to deploy a new installation and migrate the Persistent Volumes Claims (PVC) to the new release by attaching them on the current Persistent Volumes.
