ARTEMIS is an open-source tool, that implements a defense approach against BGP prefix hijacking attacks.
It is (a) based on accurate and fast detection operated by the AS itself, by leveraging the pervasiveness of publicly
available BGP monitoring services, and it (b) enables flexible and fast mitigation of hijacking events.
Compared to existing approaches/tools, ARTEMIS combines characteristics desirable to network operators such as
comprehensiveness, accuracy, speed, privacy, and flexibility. With the ARTEMIS approach, prefix hijacking can be
neutralized within a minute!

## General

Depending on the preferences of the user, ARTEMIS can be used in 3 basic modes according to the combination of enabled micro-services in the user interface:
1. Passive monitor (monitoring enabled)
2. Passive detector (monitoring + detection enabled)
3. Active joint detector and user-triggered mitigator (monitoring + detection + mitigation enabled)

*Any of these combinations is valid. To start with, we recommend using mode (2).
Mode (3) is under development (currently only a mitigation wrapper is offered).*

You can read more about the ARTEMIS methodology, blog posts, presentations, publications and research experiments
on the ARTEMIS [webpage](https://bgpartemis.org).

This repository contains the software of ARTEMIS as a tool.
ARTEMIS can be run on a server/VM as a modular and extensible
multi-container (microservice) application. It has been officially tested at
AMS-IX, a major greek ISP, FORTH (a dual-homed edge academic network),
and Internet2 (a major US R&E backbone network). Several other network operators use it either in production or in a testing environment.

## Features

For a detailed list of supported features please check the [CHANGELOG](docs/changelog.md) file
(sections: "Added"). The following main features are supported:

* Real-time monitoring of the changes in the BGP routes of the prefixes originated by the AS running ARTEMIS, via:
  * [RIPE RIS live](https://ris-live.ripe.net/)
  * [RIPE RIS RIB collections](https://bgpstream.caida.org/data#!ris)
  * [RouteViews RIB collections](https://bgpstream.caida.org/data#!routeviews)
  * Local BGP feeds ([exaBGP](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp))
  * [Private BMP feeds](https://bgpstream.caida.org/v2-beta#bmp-private)
* Real-time detection and notifications of BGP prefix hijacking attacks/events of the following types (please refer to the attack taxonomy in our [ARTEMIS IEEE/ACM ToN paper](https://www.inspire.edu.gr/wp-content/pdfs/artemis_TON2018.pdf)):
  * exact-prefix, type 0/1, any data plane manipulation
  * sub-prefix, any type (0/1/-), any data plane manipulation
  * squatting attacks, type 0 (others are N/A), any data plane manipulation
  * policy violations (route leaks) due to long paths towards no-export prefixes
* Automatic/custom tagging of detected BGP hijack events (ongoing, resolved, ignored, under mitigation, withdrawn, outdated and dormant).
* Manual or manually controlled mitigation of BGP prefix hijacking attacks.
* Comprehensive web-based User Interface (UI).
* Configuration file editable by the operator (directly or via the UI),
containing information about: prefixes, ASNs, monitors and ARTEMIS rules ("ASX originates prefix P and advertises it to ASY").
* Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes (millions of routed prefixes depending on your resources).
* Support for both mobile and desktop environments (UI): [sample screenshots](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webapp/#ui-overview-with-screenshots).
* Support for `docker-compose` (local single-server deployment) and `Kubernetes` (helm charts).
* Support for multiple modes of operation (passive monitor/detector, active mitigator, etc.).
* Support for historical BGP update replaying.
* Support for automated generation of the configuration file.
* Support for RPKI validation of hijacked prefixes.
* Compatibility with `Grafana` charts.
* Modularity/extensibility by design.
* CI/CD (Travis CI, Codecov).

## System Architecture

Please check [this page](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/).

## Getting Started

ARTEMIS is built as a multi-container Docker application.
The following instructions will get you a containerized
copy of the ARTEMIS tool up and running on your local machine using the `docker-compose` utility.
For instructions on how to set up ARTEMIS
in a Kubernetes environment, please check the related [docs page](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kubernetes/).

## Minimum Technical Requirements

* CPU: 4 cores (note that needed CPU cores depend on the number of separate processes, e.g., detectors or database modules you spawn)
* RAM: 4+ GB (note that needed memory depends on the number of configured prefixes/rules/asns and load of incoming BGP updates, see [here](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirements/#memory-requirements) for more details)
* HDD: 50 GB (less may suffice, depending on the use case for storing BGP updates and hijack alerts)
* NETWORK: 1 public-facing network interface (optionally: one internal interface for connection with local route collectors)
* OS: Ubuntu Linux 16.04+ (other Linux distributions will work too)
* SW PACKAGES: `docker-ce` and `docker-compose` should be pre-installed (see instructions later) and `docker` should have sudo privileges, if only non-sudo user is allowed
* Other: `SSH` server

Moreover, one may optionally configure firewall rules related to the server/VM.
We recommend using [ufw](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-16-04)
for this task. Please check the comments in the respective script we provide and
set the corresponding <> fields in the file before running:
```
sudo ./other/ufw_setup.sh
```
**NOTE: For security reasons, we highly recommend protecting your machine with such rules. ARTEMIS tries to minimize external port exposure to minimize the attack surface on the system itself.**

## How to Install and Setup

To download and install the required software packages, please follow steps 1 through 6 described
in [this docs section](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installsetup/#install-packages).

To setup the tool (as well as https access to it via the web application),
please follow steps 1 through 5 described
in [this docs section](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installsetup/#setup-tool).

*Note that specifically for testing purposes, we now support `vagrant` and `VirtualBox` VM automation;
please check out [this docs page](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vagrant/) for simple instructions on how to spin up a fully functioning ARTEMIS VM, running all needed microservices, within a minute.*

## How to Run and Configure

1. Start ARTEMIS:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   *Please consult [this docs section](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running/) if you need to activate additional services.*

5. Visit web UI and configure ARTEMIS:

   ```
   https://<ARTEMIS_HOST>
   ```
   By visiting the system page:
   ```
   https://<ARTEMIS_HOST>/admin/system
   ```
   you can:
   1. edit the basic configuration file of ARTEMIS that serves as the ground truth for detecting BGP hijacks (consult [this docs section](https://bgpartemis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basicconf/) first)
   2. control the monitoring, detection and mitigation modules.

6. Stop ARTEMIS (optional)

   ```
   docker-compose stop
   ```

**Note: We highly recommend going through the detailed docs instructions before using ARTEMIS for the first time.** You can further use several other microservices orthogonal to ARTEMIS (like `grafana` and `routinator`) by using the main ARTEMIS `docker-compose` yaml plus the additional yamls:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.<other_service>.yaml -... <up>/<down>/...
```

## Demo

A running demo of ARTEMIS based on the configuration of our home institute (FORTH) can be found [here](https://demo.bgpartemis.org).
You can access the demo as a guest (non-admin) user by using the following credentials:
* email: "guest@guest.com"
* password: "guest@artemis"

*Please do not request new accounts on the demo portal. Use the given credentials to browse ARTEMIS as a guest user. In case you need admin access, simply clone ARTEMIS locally and use the given configuration file.*
