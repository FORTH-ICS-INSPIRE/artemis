We include a Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation of a mitigation setup to be used with ARTEMIS.

The relevant (now merged into master) PR is [here](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/pull/437).

The folder with the needed scripts and configurations is [here](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/tree/master/poc_mitigate_deaggregate).

We include a script that receives the information of the hijack (id + prefix), and upon
execution advertises the two subnets of the prefix, performing deaggregation.

## PoC Setup architecture

```
 ----------------          -------------          -------------
| ExaBGP Monitor |        | MONITOR AS  |        | EXTERNAL AS |
|    AS65001     |  eBGP  |   AS65003   |  eBGP  |   AS65004   |
|      exa       | ------ | r03 (goBGP) | ------ | r04 (goBGP) |
|    1.1.1.11    |        |   1.1.1.13  |        |  1.1.1.14   |
 ----------------          -------------          -------------
        |                                  eBGP        | | eBGP
     ARTEMIS                     ----------------------- |
        |                        |                       |
 --------------          --------------          --------------
| ExaBGP Deagg |        |    PEER AS   |        |  HIJACKER AS |
|    AS65002   |  eBGP  |    AS65005   |  eBGP  |    AS65006   |
|      exa     | ------ |  r05 (goBGP) | ------ |  r06 (goBGP) |
|    1.1.1.12  |        |    1.1.1.15  |        |    1.1.1.16  |
 --------------          --------------          --------------
```

## Hijack mitigation steps
1. AS65002 announces prefix 192.168.0.0/16 legally.
2. The hijacker AS (AS65006) announces prefix 192.168.0.0/16 whose legal origin is AS65002.
3. ARTEMIS detects the hijack using its feed from AS65003 via the ExaBGP monitor.
4. ARTEMIS mitigates the hijack (by order of the user - mitigation action) by deaggregating the hijacked prefix and announcing the new
BGP updates via PEER AS AS65005.

## How to run PoC

1. In `docker-compose.yaml`, edit volumes to point to the PoC's files:

    ```
    version: '3'
    services:
      backend:
        ...
        volumes:
          - ./poc_mitigate_deaggregate/configs/artemis/:/etc/artemis/
          - ./poc_mitigate_deaggregate/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py:/root/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py
          - ./backend/supervisor.d/:/etc/supervisor/conf.d/
      ...
    ```

2. Run the following command and check the ARTEMIS UI:

   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml up -d
   ```
3. Connect to `r06` and  announce the hijacked prefix:

   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml exec r06 sh
   gobgp global rib add 192.168.0.0/16
   ```
4. Observe the hijack in ARTEMIS and initiate the mitigation action.

## How to run in production (to be tested)

In case you want to run this in production you can adjust [`poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py`](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/blob/master/poc_mitigate_deaggregate/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py) and [`docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml`](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/blob/master/docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml) as needed. So the following steps would be required:

1. Adjust [`poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py`](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/blob/master/poc_mitigate_deaggregate/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py) so that it applies what you want it to apply.

2. In `docker-compose.yaml`, edit volumes to point to the mitigation file:

    ```
    version: '3'
    services:
      backend:
        ...
        volumes:
          - ./poc_mitigate_deaggregate/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py:/root/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py
      ...
    ```

3. Edit the [exabgp configuration files](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/tree/master/poc_mitigate_deaggregate/configs/exabgp) according to your router setup. Note that the `monitor` is passive (receiving updates from routers), while the `routecommander` active (sending updates to routers).

4. Adjust [`docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml`](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/blob/master/docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml) so that it maps to your setup (networking, keeping only the exabgp containers, etc.).

5. Initiate ARTEMIS with the new microservices:

   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.pocmitigatedeaggregate.yaml up -d
   ```

6. Edit your ARTEMIS configuration file at will:

   ```
   rules:
   - prefixes:
     ...
     origin_asns:
     ...
     neighbors:
     ...
     mitigation:
     "/root/poc_mitigate_deaggregate.py"
   ```

## Notes

1. Currently we do not support "stopping" deaggregation (only triggering via the ARTEMIS UI action), but we monitor its effects within the hijack event.
2. Feedback is more than welcome, feel free to expand this section!
