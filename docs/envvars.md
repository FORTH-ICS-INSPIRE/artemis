```
Database auto-backup (true or false) and auto-clean (how many hours before to remove) of non-hijack BGP updates:
```

## Auto-recovery of intended process states
AUTO_RECOVER_PROCESS_STATE=true # flag to signal whether ARTEMIS should auto-enforce intended process state (running/stopped) on startup

## Notes on decoupling env file from current location
Note that at the current time, it is not advised to move the `.env` file to another folder because it is still an ongoing issue to support external .env files in the docker-compose repository
[docker/compose#6170](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6170). However, since we deal with environment variables, you can delete the `.env` file and actually import them through another script that is located somewhere else. if [this issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/6535) gets merged, then you can use a different env file with --env-file. Otherwise, you can run it with something like:
```
env $(cat path/to/env) docker-compose up
```
