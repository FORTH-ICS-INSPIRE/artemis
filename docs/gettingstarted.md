# Getting Started

ARTEMIS is built as a multi-container Docker application.
The following instructions will get you a containerized
copy of the ARTEMIS tool up and running on your local machine using the `docker-compose` utility.
For instructions on how to set up ARTEMIS
in a Kubernetes environment, please check the related [Wiki page](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki/Kubernetes-Deployment).

## Minimum Technical Requirements

* CPU: 4 cores (note that needed CPU cores depend on the number of separate processes, e.g., detectors or database modules you spawn)
* RAM: 4+ GB (note that needed memory depends on the number of configured prefixes/rules/asns and load of incoming BGP updates, see [here](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki#memory-requirements) for more details)
* HDD: 50 GB (less may suffice, depending on the use case for storing BGP updates and hijack alerts)
* NETWORK: 1 public-facing network interface (optionally: one internal interface for connection with local route collectors)
* OS: Ubuntu Linux 16.04+ (other Linux distributions will work too)
* SW PACKAGES: `docker-ce` and `docker-compose` should be pre-installed (see instructions later) and `docker` should have sudo privileges, if only non-sudo user is allowed
* Other: `SSH` server

Moreover, one may optionally configure firewall rules related to the server/VM.
We recommend using [ufw](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-16-04)
for this task. Please check the comments in the respective script we provide and
set the corresponding <> fields in the file before running:
```
sudo ./other/ufw_setup.sh
```
**NOTE: For security reasons, we highly recommend protecting your machine with such rules. ARTEMIS tries to minimize external port exposure to minimize the attack surface on the system itself.**

## How to Install and Setup

To download and install the required software packages, please follow steps 1 through 6 described in [this Wiki section](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki#install-packages).

To setup the tool (as well as https access to it via the web application), please follow steps 1 through 5 described in [this Wiki section](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki#setup-tool).

*Note that specifically for testing purposes, we now support `vagrant` and `VirtualBox` VM automation; please check out [this Wiki page](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki/Setup-an-ARTEMIS-VM-in-1-minute) for simple instructions on how to spin up a fully functioning ARTEMIS VM, running all needed microservices, within a minute.*

## How to Run and Configure

1. Start ARTEMIS:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   *Please consult [this Wiki section](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki#starting-artemis) if you need to activate additional services.*

2. Visit web UI and configure ARTEMIS:

   ```
   https://<ARTEMIS_HOST>
   ```

   By visiting the system page:

   ```
   https://<ARTEMIS_HOST>/admin/system
   ```

   you can:

   1. edit the basic configuration file of ARTEMIS that serves as the ground truth for detecting BGP hijacks (consult [this Wiki section](https://github.com/FORTH-ICS-INSPIRE/artemis/wiki/Configuration-file) first)
   2. control the monitoring, detection and mitigation modules.

3. Stop ARTEMIS (optional)

   ```
   docker-compose stop
   ```

**Note: We highly recommend going through the detailed wiki instructions before using ARTEMIS for the first time.** You can further use several other microservices orthogonal to ARTEMIS (like `grafana` and `routinator`) by using the main ARTEMIS `docker-compose` yaml plus the additional yamls:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.<other_service>.yaml -... <up>/<down>/...
```

## Demo

A running demo of ARTEMIS based on the configuration of our home institute (FORTH) can be found [here](https://demo.bgpartemis.org).

You can access the demo as a guest (non-admin) user by using the following credentials:

```
username: "guest"
password: "guest@artemis"
```

*Please do not request new accounts on the demo portal. Use the given credentials to browse ARTEMIS as a guest user. In case you need admin access, simply clone ARTEMIS locally and use the given configuration file.*
