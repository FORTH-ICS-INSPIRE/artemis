# Routinator Configuration
#
# The configuration file is a TOML file. It consists of a sequence of
# key-value pairs, each on its own line. Strings are to be enclosed in
# double quotes. Lists of values can be given by enclosing a
# comma-separated sequence of these values in square brackets.
#
# See https://github.com/toml-lang/toml for detailed information on the
# format.
#
# This file contains all configuration settings with explanations and their
# default values.

# Repository directory
#
# This is where Routinator stores the local copy of the RPKI repository.
# Any relative path is interpreted with respect to the directory this config
# lives in.
#
# This setting is mandatory.
#
repository-dir = "rpki-repo"

# Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) directory
#
# All the files with the extension ".tal" in this directory are treated as
# trust anchor locators for RPKI validation.
#
# A relative path is interpreted with respect to the directory this config
# lives in.
#
# This setting is mandatory.
#
tal-dir = ".rpki-cache/tals"

# Local exceptions files
#
# This settings contains a array of paths to files that contain local
# exceptions. The files are JSON files according to RFC 8416 (aka SLURM).
#exceptions = []

# Strict mode
#
# If strict mode, Routinator will stick to the requirements in the respective
# RFCs very strictly. See
# https://github.com/NLnetLabs/rpki-rs/blob/master/doc/relaxed-validation.md
# for information on what is allowed when strict mode is off.
#strict = false

# Rsync command
#
# This is the command to run as rsync. This is only command, no options.
#rsync-command = "rsync"

# Rsync arguments
#
# This is a list of arguments to give to rsync.
#rsync-args = []

# Number of parallel rsync commands
#
# This is the maximum number of rsync commands that are run in parallel.
# We are not sure, if the current default is any good. Some feedback whether
# it is causing trouble or whether a higher value would even be fine is very
# much appreciated.
#
#rsync-count = 4

# Number of validation threads
#
# The number of threads that are used for validating the repository. The
# default value is the number of CPUs.
#validation-threads = NUMBER

# Refresh interval
#
# How often the repository should be updated and validated in RTR mode.
# Specifically, this is the number of seconds the process will wait after
# having finished validation before starting the next update.
#
# The default is the value indirectly recommended by RFC 8210.
#refresh = 3600

# RTR retry interval
#
# This is the time an RTR client is told to wait before retrying a failed
# query in seconds.
#retry = 600

# RTR expire interval
#
# This is the time an RTR client is told to keep using data if it can't
# refresh it.
#expire = 7200

# History size
#
# The number of deltas to keep. If a client requests an older delta, it is
# served the entire set again.
#
# There was no particular reason for choosing the default ...
#history-size = 10

# Listen addresses for RTR TCP transport.
#
# This is an array of strings, each string a socket address of the form
# "address:port" with IPv6 address in square brackets.
#rtr-listen = ["127.0.0.1:3323"]

# Listen addresses for Prometheus HTTP monitoring endpoint.
#
# This is an array of strings, each string a socket address of the form
# "address:port" with IPv6 address in square brackets.
#
# Port 9556 is allocated for the routinator exporter.
# https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations

#http-listen = ...

# Log level
#
# The maximum log level ("off", "error", "warn", "info", or "debug") for
# which to log messages.
#log-level = "warn"

# Log target
#
# Where to log to. One of "stderr" for stderr, "syslog" for syslog, or "file"
# for a file. If "file" is given, the "log-file" field needs to be given, too.
#
# Can also be "default", in which case "syslog" is used in daemon mode and
# "stderr" otherwise
#log = "default"

# Syslog facility
#
# The syslog facility to log to if syslog logging is used.
#syslog-facility = "daemon"

# Log file
#
# The path to the file to log to if file logging is used. If the path is
# relative, it is relative to the directory this config file lives in.
#log-file = ...

# Daemon PID file
#
# When in daemon mode, Routinator can store its process ID in a file given
# through this entry. It will keep that file locked while running. By default,
# no pid file is used.
#pid-file = ...

# Daemon working directory
#
# If this entry is given, the daemon process will change its working directory
# to this directory. Otherwise it remains in the current directory.
#working-dir = ...

# Daemon Chroot
#
# If this entry is given, the daemon process will change its root directory to
# this directory. Startup will fail if any of the other directories given is
# not within this directory.
#chroot = ...
